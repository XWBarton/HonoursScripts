How to build a database for the use of Kraken2:

In order to build a kraken database you must perform three steps:

1. Download taxonomy
	- This downloads all the genera metadata etc from NCBI so things can be classified
	- The command is: 
	- kraken2-build --download-taxonomy --db [YOUR_DB_NAME]

2. Add genomes to library
	- Genomes can be added to the library in 2 ways:

		- You can add one of the standard genomes sets using the command:
		- kraken2-build --download-library [YOUR_CHOICE_OF_SET] --db [YOUR_DB_NAME]
		- Your choice of sets include:
			- archea
			- bacteria
			- plasmid
			- viral
			- human
			- fungi
			- plant
			- protozoa
			- and others which can be found in the Kraken2 manual: https://github.com/DerrickWood/kraken2/wiki/Manual#classification

		- You can also add your own genomes:
		- If the files have been downloaded directly of NCBI theoretically* you wont have to reformat them *THEORETICALLY
		- The command is:
		- kraken2-build --add-to-library [LOCATION_OF_YOUR_GENOME] --db [YOUR_DB_NAME]

3. Build database from library
	- This is now executing the construction of the kraken database from all of the genomes you just added to your library
	- This may take a long time depeding on how powerful your computer is and how many files are in your library 
	- The command is:
	- kraken2-build --build --db [YOUR_DB_NAME] 

Notes:

- [YOUR_DB_NAME] is basically just a name of a folder that you have created, where you want to put all of this info or your data-base
